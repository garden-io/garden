# Graph v2 notes

Actions exist in three stages:

**The base**
Partially resolved without dependencies resolved, and `variables` and the type-specific `spec` fields only partially
resolved. This is what's in `ConfigGraph` upon resolution.

**Resolved**
Fully resolved in terms of its configuration, variables, and all its dependencies, but does not have all outputs
available. This is enough to call e.g. `getStatus`, `build`, `deploy` handlers.

**Executed**
Includes runtime outputs that are only available after building, deploying etc. These are necessary to resolve
dependencies that reference action outputs.

The "do" tasks (`BuildTask`, `DeployTask` etc.) for each action kind, plus `DeleteDeployTask`, are the only ones that
don't require an action.
