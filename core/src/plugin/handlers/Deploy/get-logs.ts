    Retrieve a stream of logs for the specified deployment, optionally waiting for new logs.

    Note that when not listening for new logs, all logs are loaded into memory and sorted. The plugin handler should therefore take care to set a sensible limit on the number of log lines retrieved.

    Called by the \`garden logs\` command.
