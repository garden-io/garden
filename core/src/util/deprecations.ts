        <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
        To suppress this warning and adopt the new behaviour described below, change the \`apiVersion\` setting in your project-level configuration to \`garden.io/v2\` (See also [The ${style(`apiVersion`)} config field](#apiversion)).

        ### Why

        <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
        Garden 0.14 will use the Garden Cloud/Enterprise backend for determining the cache status of Kubernetes \`Test\` and \`Run\` actions kinds (See also [${style("ConfigMap")}-based cache for Kubernetes actions](#configmapbasedcache)).

        While we also introduce a local file-based cache backend, this means the cache results from other team members will only be available when you're logged in to Garden Cloud/Enterprise.

        Logging in also enables you to use our Remote Container Builder which can significantly improve your Docker build performance.

        To prevent your team from suffering from cache misses and bad performance, we'll require you to log in if your project is connected to Garden Cloud/Enterprise. A project is _connected_ if the project-level Garden configuration has \`id\` and \`domain\` fields set.

        ### Offline mode

        **We don't want to be in your way if you can't log in right now**, be it because you are lacking permissions or because you're offline.

        This is why we also offer an escape hatch: If you want to proceed without logging in, just call Garden with the option \`--offline\` or the environment variable \`GARDEN_OFFLINE=1\`.
      `,
    },
    configMapBasedCache: {
      docsSection: "Garden commands",
      docsHeadline: `${style("ConfigMap")}-based cache for Kubernetes actions`,
      warnHint: dedent`
        The ${style("ConfigMap")}-based cache will not be available anymore in Garden 0.14.
      `,
      docs: dedent`
        Instead, Garden 0.14 will introduce two new cache storage options: A local file-based cache and a Team Cache as part of Garden Cloud/Enterprise.

        <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
        To suppress this warning, change the \`apiVersion\` setting in your project-level configuration to \`garden.io/v2\` (See also [The ${style(`apiVersion`)} config field](#apiversion)).

        ### Why

        We are making this change because \`ConfigMap\` resources in your Kubernetes cluster are not designed for storing \`Test\` and \`Run\` action statuses and have limitations on the amount of data that can be stored for each cache entry.

        We've seen Kubernetes clusters where the number of \`ConfigMap\` resources grew significantly and caused reliability issues.

        Additionally, the storage location of the cache limits the functionality: it's impossible, for instance, to share test results across multiple Kubernetes clusters. If your team is using the \`local-kubernetes\` provider, they cannot benefit from the cache of other team members.

        ### Team Cache backend

        With Garden 0.14, we are offering a **Team Cache** option with a new storage backend in Garden Cloud/Enterprise, putting us in the position of bringing Garden caching capabilities to the next level.

        The Team Cache backend will be enabled by default for all projects that are connected to Garden Cloud/Enterprise. A project is _connected_ if the project-level Garden configuration has \`id\` and \`domain\` fields set.

        <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
        We'll also introduce a login requirement for these projects. See also [Login Requirement](#loginrequirement) for more information.

        ### File-based backend

        For projects that aren't connected to Garden Cloud/Enterprise, or when you're using the \`--offline\` option, we will automatically fall back to a file-based cache backend.

        Garden will skip \`Test\` and \`Run\` actions that already ran from your local machine, but team members and CI workflows won't be able to benefit from the cache entries on your local machine.

      `,
      docs: dedent`
        Garden uses the \`apiVersion\` setting in your project configuration to understand which version of Garden your configuration has been written for.

        Garden 0.14 (Cedar) will only support the setting \`apiVersion: garden.io/v2\` in your project configuration file. Using this setting in the latest versions of Garden 0.13 (Bonsai) will reject using functionality that is not supported in Garden 0.14 (Cedar) anymore.

        Using \`apiVersion: garden.io/v0\`, or not specifying \`apiVersion\` at all in the project configuration, indicates the configuration has been written for Garden version 0.12 (Acorn), and using \`apiVersion: garden.io/v1\` means your configuration has been written for Garden version 0.13 (Bonsai). **These settings will not be supported anymore in Garden 0.14 (Cedar)**.

        Full Example:
        \`\`\`yaml
        # project.garden.yml
        apiVersion: garden.io/v1 # <-- This indicates that the configuration has been written for Garden 0.13 (Bonsai).
        kind: Project
        name: garden-core

        environments:
         - name: dev

        providers:
         - name: local-kubernetes
        \`\`\`

        Please follow the steps in this document when Garden tells you that you're affected by changed behaviour in 0.14. After that, you can change your \`apiVersion\` setting to \`garden.io/v2\`:

        \`\`\`yaml
        # project.garden.yml
        apiVersion: garden.io/v2 # <-- Use this setting to adopt the new behaviour in Garden 0.14. Your configuration will work with the latest versions of Garden 0.13, and with any version of Garden 0.14.

      docs: dedent`
        Instead of using \`build\`, please reference the \`deploymentImageId\` output explicitly in each affected \`Deploy\`, \`Run\` and \`Test\` action spec of the \`container\` action type.

        Other action types, like the \`exec\`, \`kubernetes\` and \`helm\` action types, are not affected and \`build\` can still be used to control the build staging directory of the action.

        Referring to a container image via the \`build\` config field was confusing to some of our users, as it does not work for all action types that can reference containers, for example in \`kubernetes\` and \`helm\` actions configs.

        That's why we decided to drop support for referencing container images via the \`build\` config field.

        For example, a configuration like

        \`\`\`yaml
        kind: Build
        name: backend
        description: Backend service container image
        type: container

        ---
        kind: Deploy
        name: backend
        description: Backend service container
        type: container
        build: backend # <-- old config style uses \`build\` field. The \`spec.image\` did not need to be specified.
        \`\`\`

        should be replaced with

        \`\`\`yaml
        kind: Build
        name: backend
        description: Backend service container image
        type: container

        ---
        kind: Deploy
        name: backend
        description: Backend service container
        type: container
        spec:
          image: \${actions.build.backend.outputs.deploymentImageId} # <--- the new config style is more explicit.
        \`\`\`

        Garden automatically determines the execution order of actions (First building the backend container, then deploying the backend) based on the output references.

    optionalTemplateValueSyntax: {
      docsSection: "Template Language",
      docsHeadline: `Optional template expressions`,
      warnHint: `The optional template expression syntax will be removed in Garden 0.14. Use explicit fallback values instead, e.g. ${style(`\${var.foo || null}`)}.`,
      docs: dedent`
        The optional template expression syntax can be used to mark a template expression as optional, meaning there will not be an error when looking up a variable inside the template expression fails.

        Using a question mark (\`?\`) following a template expression to mark it as optional led to surprising and/or undesired behaviour in some cases.

        In the following example, users would expect \`var.fullUrl\` to evaluate to \`https://example.com/?param=xyz\`.

        \`\`\`yaml
        # ...
        variables:
          baseUrl: https://example.com/
          fullUrl: \${var.baseUrl}?param=xyz # <-- users expect this to evaluate to https://example.com/?param=xyz
        \`\`\`

        Due to the optional template expression syntax, the value behind \`var.fullUrl\` actually evaluates to \`https://example.com/param=xyz\` (Notice the missing question mark after the value of \`var.baseUrl\`) when using \`apiVersion: garden.io/v1\`.

        For this reason, we will remove the optional template expression syntax. You can adopt the new behaviour and prepare your configuration files for the release of Garden 0.14 by using \`apiVersion: garden.io/v2\` in the project-level configuration.

        When using \`apiVersion: garden.io/v2\`, the optional template syntax has been removed and thus \`var.fullUrl\` evaluates to \`https://example.com/?param=xyz\` and resolving the action will fail if \`var.baseUrl\` doesn't exist.

        You can use explicit fallback values using the logical or operator in case you've been relying on the optional template expression syntax.
