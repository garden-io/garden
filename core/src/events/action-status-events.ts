/**
 * This type represents the lifecycle of an individual action execution as emitted to Cloud. Note that the
 * internal semantics are slightly different (e.g. Garden uses "ready" instead of "cached" internally).
 *
 * The state transitions that take place when an action goes through the standard "check status and execute the
 * action if no up-to date result exists" flow (as is done in the primary task classes) is as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * initial state: "getting-status"
 * final state: "cached", ready" or "failed"
 *
 * "getting-status" -> "cached" | "not-ready"
 * "not-ready" -> "processing"
 * "processing" -> "ready" | "failed"
 * ```
 *
 * See also the following state transition diagram (created with https://asciiflow.com):
 *
 *                                           ┌──────► (No-op, done)
 *                                           │

 *                                           │
 *                  ┌──► cached ──► force? ──┤
 *                  │                        │
 * getting-status ──┤                        │ true               ┌──► failed

 *
 * The states have the following semantics:
 *
 * - `"unknown"`: A null state used e.g. by default/no-op action handlers.
 *
 * - `"getting-status"`: The status of the action is being checked/fetched.
 *   - For example, for a container build status check, this might involve querying a container registry to see if a
 *     build exists for the requested action's version.
 *   - Or for a Kubernetes deployment, this might involve checking if the requested resources are already live and up
 *     to date.
 *
 * - `"cached"`: This state indicates a cache hit. An up-to-date result exists for the action.
 *   - This state can be reached e.g. when a status check indicates that an up-to-date build artifact / deployed
 *     resource / test result / run result already exists.
 *
 * - `"ready"`: The action was executed successfully, and an up-to-date result exists for the action.
 *   - This state can be reached by successfully processing the action after getting a `"not-ready"` state from the
 *     status check.
 *   - Think of this as "succeeded".
 *   - Note that in the case of Test actions, the action itself will return a "ready" state even if the test itself
 *     failed, because the action execution was successful.
 *
 * - `"not-ready"`: No result (or no healthy result) for the action exists with the requested version.
 *   - This state is reached by a status check that doesn't find an up-to-date result (e.g. no up-to-date container
 *     image, or a deployed resource that's missing, unhealthy, stopped or out of date with the requested action's
 *     version).
 *
 * - `"processing"`: The action is being executed.
 *
 * - `"failed"`: Getting the status or processing the action failed with an unexpected error so no up-to-date
 *   result was created for the action.
 *   - Note that in the case of Test actions, this does not suggest that the underlying test failed, but rather
 *     that the action itself failed and the test status is simply unknown.
