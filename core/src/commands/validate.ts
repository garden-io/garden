      Fully resolve a specific action, including references to runtime outputs from other actions. Actions should be specified as \`<kind>.<name>\` (e.g. \`deploy.my-service\` or \`build.my-image\`). This option can be specified multiple times to fully resolve multiple actions. Use * to fully resolve all actions. Note that this may result in actions being executed during validation (e.g. if a runtime output is referenced by another action, it will be executed in order to fully resolve the config). In such cases, we recommend not using this option.
