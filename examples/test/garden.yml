    # Flag the environment as a production environment.
    #
    # Setting this flag to `true` will activate the protection on the `deploy`, `test`, `task`, `build`,
    # and `dev` commands. A protected command will ask for a user confirmation every time is run agains
    # an environment marked as production.
    # Run the command with the "--yes" flag to skip the check (e.g. when running Garden in CI).
    #
    # This flag is also passed on to every provider, and may affect how certain providers behave.
    # For more details please check the documentation for the providers in use.

    # Specify a path (relative to the project root) to a file containing variables, that we apply on top of the
    # _environment-specific_ `variables` field. The file should be in a standard "dotenv" format, specified
    # here (https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
    #
    # If you don't set the field and the `garden.<env-name>.env` file does not exist,
    # we simply ignore it. If you do override the default value and the file doesn't exist, an error will be thrown.

    # A key/value map of variables that modules can reference when using this environment. These take precedence over
    # variables defined in the top-level `variables` field.
    #
    # variables: {}

# A list of providers that should be used for this project, and their configuration. Please refer to individual
# plugins/providers for details on how to configure them.
providers:
  - # The name of the provider plugin to use.
    name: local-kubernetes

    # If specified, this provider will only be used in the listed environments. Note that an empty array effectively
    # disables the provider. To use a provider in all environments, omit this field.
    #
    # environments:
    #   - dev
    #   - stage

# The default environment to use when calling commands without the `--env` parameter. Defaults to the first configured
# environment.
#
# defaultEnvironment: "dev"

# Specify a list of filenames that should be used as ".ignore" files across the project, using the same syntax and
# semantics as `.gitignore` files. By default, patterns matched in `.gitignore` and `.gardenignore` files, found
# anywhere in the project, are ignored when scanning for modules and module sources.
# Note that these take precedence over the project `module.include` field, and module `include` fields, so any paths
# matched by the .ignore files will be ignored even if they are explicitly specified in those fields.
# See the Configuration Files guide
# (https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.
#
# dotIgnoreFiles:
#   - .gardenignore
#   - .customignore

# Control where to scan for modules in the project.
#
# modules:
  # Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be scanned for Garden modules.
  #
  # Note that you can also _exclude_ path using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source
  # tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the Configuration Files guide
  # (https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.
  #
  # Unlike the `exclude` field, the paths/globs specified here have _no effect_ on which files and directories Garden
  # watches for changes. Use the `exclude` field to affect those, if you have large directories that should not be
  # watched for changes.
  #
  # Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no paths_ should be included.
  #
  # include:
  #   - modules/**/*

  # Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded when scanning for modules.
  #
  # The filters here also affect which files and directories are watched for changes. So if you have a large number of
  # directories in your project that should not be watched, you should specify them here.
  #
  # For example, you might want to exclude large vendor directories in your project from being scanned and watched, by
  # setting `exclude: [node_modules/**/*, vendor/**/*]`.
  #
  # Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include`
  # field, the paths/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`.
  #
  # The `include` field does _not_ affect which files are watched.
  #
  # See the Configuration Files guide
  # (https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.
  #
  # exclude:
  #   - public/**/*
  #   - tmp/**/*

# A list of output values that the project should export. These are exported by the `garden get outputs` command, as
# well as when referencing a project as a sub-project within another project.
#
# You may use any template strings to specify the values, including references to provider outputs, module
# outputs and runtime outputs. For a full reference, see the Output configuration context
# (https://docs.garden.io/reference/template-strings#output-configuration-context) section in the Template String
# Reference.
#
# Note that if any runtime outputs are referenced, the referenced services and tasks will be deployed and run if
# necessary when resolving the outputs.
#
# outputs:
  #-# The name of the output value.
    #
    # name: "my-output-key"

    # The value for the output. Must be a primitive (string, number, boolean or null). May also be any valid template
    # string.
    #
    # value: "${modules.my-module.outputs.some-output}"

# A list of remote sources to import into project.
#
# sources:
  #-# The name of the source to import
    #
    # name: "my-external-repo"

    # A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific
    # branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>
    #
    # repositoryUrl: "git+https://github.com/org/repo.git#v2.0"

# Specify a path (relative to the project root) to a file containing variables, that we apply on top of the
# project-wide `variables` field. The file should be in a standard "dotenv" format, specified
# here (https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
#
# If you don't set the field and the `garden.env` file does not exist, we simply ignore it.
# If you do override the default value and the file doesn't exist, an error will be thrown.
#
# _Note that in many cases it is advisable to only use environment-specific var files, instead of combining
# multiple ones. See the `environments[].varfile` field for this option._
