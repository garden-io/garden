# Rust example

Example of using the Rust programming language with Garden.

Local development with live code synchronization:

```bash
garden deploy --sync
```

Local deployment with a release mode build:

```bash
garden deploy --env release
```

_Note: the first time build might take a long time, but subsequent builds should be faster._
