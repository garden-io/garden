# Template string reference

Below you'll find the schema of the keys available when interpolating template strings (see our [Variables and Templating](../using-garden/variables-and-templating.md) guide for more information and usage examples), as well as the list of available helper functions you can use in template strings.

Note that there are multiple sections below, since different configuration sections have different keys available to them. Please make sure to refer to the correct section.

## Helper functions

## Project configuration context

The following keys are available in any template strings within project definitions in `garden.yml` config files, except the `name` field (which cannot be templated). See the [Environment](#environment-configuration-context) and [Provider](#provider-configuration-context) sections below for additional keys available when configuring `environments` and `providers`, respectively.
{{{projectContext}}}

## Remote source configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `sources` key in project configs.
{{{remoteSourceContext}}}

## Environment configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `environments` key in project configs. Additional keys are available for the `environments[].providers` field, see the [Provider](#provider-configuration-context) section below for those.
{{{environmentContext}}}

## Provider configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `providers` key (or `environments[].providers`) in project configs.

Providers can also reference outputs defined by other providers, via the `${providers.<provider-name>.outputs}` key. For details on which outputs are available for a given provider, please refer to the [reference](https://docs.garden.io/reference/providers) docs for the provider in question, and look for the _Outputs_ section.
{{{providerContext}}}

## Module configuration context

The below keys are available in template strings in module configs. These include all the keys from the sections above.

Modules can reference outputs defined by providers, via the `${providers.<provider-name>.outputs}` key. For details on which outputs are available for a given provider, please refer to the [reference](https://docs.garden.io/reference/providers) docs for the provider in question, and look for the _Outputs_ section.

Modules can also reference outputs defined by other modules, via the `${modules.<module-name>.outputs}` key, as well as service and task outputs via the `${runtime.services.<service-name>.outputs}` and `${runtime.tasks.<task-name>.outputs}` keys.
For details on which outputs are available for a given module type, please refer to the [reference](https://docs.garden.io/reference/module-types) docs for the module type in question, and look for the _Outputs_ section.
{{{moduleContext}}}

## Output configuration context

The below keys are available in template strings for _project outputs_, specified in `outputs[].value` keys in project config files. These include all the keys from the sections above.

Output values can reference outputs defined by providers, via the `${providers.<provider-name>.outputs}` key. For details on which outputs are available for a given provider, please refer to the [reference](https://docs.garden.io/reference/providers) docs for the provider in question, and look for the _Outputs_ section.

Output values may also reference outputs defined by modules, via the `${modules.<module-name>.outputs}` key, as well as service and task outputs via the `${runtime.services.<service-name>.outputs}` and `${runtime.tasks.<task-name>.outputs}` keys.
For details on which outputs are available for a given module type, please refer to the [reference](https://docs.garden.io/reference/module-types) docs for the module type in question, and look for the _Outputs_ section.
{{{outputContext}}}

## Workflow configuration context

The below keys are available in template strings for Workflow configurations.

Note that the `{steps.*}` key is only available for the `steps[].command` and `steps[].script` fields in Workflow configs, and may only reference previous steps in the same workflow. See below for more details.
{{{workflowContext}}}
