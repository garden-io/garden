# Project Configuration Reference

Below is the schema reference for Project configuration files.

The reference is divided into two sections:
* [YAML Schema](#yaml-schema) contains the Project config YAML schema
* [Configuration keys](#configuration-keys) describes each individual schema key for Project configuration files.

Note that individual providers, e.g. `kubernetes`, add their own project level configuration keys. The provider types are listed on the [Providers page](../reference/providers/README.md).

Please refer to those for more details on provider configuration.

## YAML Schema
