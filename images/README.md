# Images

Here we place container images that we maintain and reference when using Garden.

To build, just use `garden build`, and to publish, `garden publish`.

## Buildkit

Garden Acorn (0.12) uses the `buildkit` image from
the [main branch](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/tree/main/images/buildkit) and no longer maintains own version.
