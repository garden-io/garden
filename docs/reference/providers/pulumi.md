# `pulumi` Provider

## Description

**EXPERIMENTAL**

This provider allows you to integrate [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com) stacks into your Garden project, via [`pulumi` Deploy actions](../action-types/Deploy/pulumi.md).

Below is the full schema reference for the provider configuration. For an introduction to configuring a Garden project with providers, please look at our [configuration guide](../../using-garden/configuration-overview.md).

The reference is divided into two sections. The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

## Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
providers:
  - # The name of the provider plugin to use.
    name:

    # List other providers that should be resolved before this one.
    dependencies: []

    # If specified, this provider will only be used in the listed environments. Note that an empty array effectively
    # disables the provider. To use a provider in all environments, omit this field.
    environments:

    # The version of pulumi to use. Set to `null` to use whichever version of `pulumi` is on your PATH.
    version: 3.122.0

    # Overrides the default plan directory path used when deploying with the `deployFromPreview` option for pulumi
    # deploy actions.
    #
    # Must be a relative path to a directory inside the project root.
    #
    # This option can be useful when you want to provide a folder of pre-approved pulumi plans to a CI pipeline step.
    previewDir:

    # The name of the pulumi organization to use. This option can also be set on the deploy action level, in which
    # case it
    # overrides this provider-level option. Note that setting the organization name is only necessary when using
    # pulumi managed backend with an organization.
    orgName:

    # The URL of the state backend endpoint used. This option can also be set on the deploy action level, in which
    # case it
    # overrides this  provider-level option. Set this option as per list of available self-managed state backends on
    # https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/state/#using-a-self-managed-backend
    backendURL: https://api.pulumi.com

    # Sets the maximum task concurrency for the tasks generated by the pulumi plugin commands (e.g. when running
    # `garden plugins pulumi preview`).
    #
    # Note: This limit is not applied when running built-in commands (e.g. `garden deploy`).
    pluginTaskConcurrencyLimit: 5
```
