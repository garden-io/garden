# `jib` Provider

## Description

**EXPERIMENTAL**: Please provide feedback via GitHub issues or our community forum!

Provides support for [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) via the [jib action type](../action-types/Build/jib-container.md).

Use this to efficiently build container images for Java services. Check out the [jib example](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/tree/0.13.37/examples/jib-container) to see it in action.

Below is the full schema reference for the provider configuration. For an introduction to configuring a Garden project with providers, please look at our [configuration guide](../../using-garden/configuration-overview.md).

The reference is divided into two sections. The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

## Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
providers:
  - # The name of the provider plugin to use.
    name:

    # List other providers that should be resolved before this one.
    dependencies: []

    # If specified, this provider will only be used in the listed environments. Note that an empty array effectively
    # disables the provider. To use a provider in all environments, omit this field.
    environments:
```
