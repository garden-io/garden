# `jib` Provider

## Description

**EXPERIMENTAL**: Please provide feedback via GitHub issues or our community forum!

Provides support for [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) via the [jib action type](../action-types/Build/jib-container.md).

Use this to efficiently build container images for Java services. Check out the [jib example](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/tree/0.14.4/examples/jib-container) to see it in action.

Below is the full schema reference for the provider configuration..

The reference is divided into two sections. The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

## Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
providers:
  - # The name of the provider plugin to use.
    name:

    # List other providers that should be resolved before this one.
    dependencies: []

    # If specified, this provider will only be used in the listed environments. Note that an empty array effectively
    # disables the provider. To use a provider in all environments, omit this field.
    environments:

    preInit:
      # A script to run before the provider is initialized. This is useful for performing any provider-specific setup
      # outside of Garden. For example, you can use this to perform authentication, such as authenticating with a
      # Kubernetes cluster provider.
      # The script will always be run from the project root directory.
      # Note that provider statuses are cached, so this script will generally only be run once, but you can force a
      # re-run by setting `--force-refresh` on any Garden command that uses the provider.
      runScript:
```
