## Garden CLI commands

Below is a list of Garden CLI commands and usage information.

The commands should be run in a Garden project, and are always scoped to that project.

Note: You can get a list of commands in the CLI by running `garden -h/--help`,
and detailed help for each command using `garden <command> -h/--help`

The _Outputs_ sections show the output structure when running the command with `--output yaml`. The same structure is used when `--output json` is used and when querying through the REST API, but in JSON format.

##### Global options

The following option flags can be used with any of the CLI commands:

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--root` |  | path | Override project root directory (defaults to working directory). Can be absolute or relative to current directory.
  | `--env` |  | string | The environment (and optionally namespace) to work against.
  | `--force-refresh` |  | boolean | Force refresh of any caches, e.g. cached provider statuses.
  | `--var` |  | array:string | Set a specific variable value, using the format &lt;key&gt;&#x3D;&lt;value&gt;, e.g. &#x60;--var some-key&#x3D;custom-value&#x60;. This will override any value set in your project configuration. You can specify multiple variables by separating with a comma, e.g. &#x60;--var key-a&#x3D;foo,key-b&#x3D;&quot;value with quotes&quot;&#x60;.
  | `--yes` |  | boolean | Automatically approve any yes/no prompts during execution, and allow running protected commands against production environments.
  | `--silent` |  | boolean | Suppress log output. Same as setting --logger-type&#x3D;quiet.
  | `--logger-type` |  | `quiet` `default` `basic` `json` `ink`  | Set logger type. default The default Garden logger, basic: [DEPRECATED] An alias for &quot;default&quot;. json: Renders log lines as JSON. quiet: Suppresses all log output, same as --silent.
  | `--log-level` |  | `error` `warn` `info` `verbose` `debug` `silly` `0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5`  | Set logger level. Values can be either string or numeric and are prioritized from 0 to 5 (highest to lowest) as follows: error: 0, warn: 1, info: 2, verbose: 3, debug: 4, silly: 5. From the verbose log level onward action execution logs are also printed (e.g. test or run live log outputs).
  | `--output` |  | `json` `yaml`  | Output command result in specified format (note: disables progress logging and interactive functionality).
  | `--emoji` |  | boolean | Enable emoji in output (defaults to true if the environment supports it).
  | `--show-timestamps` |  | boolean | Show timestamps with log output. When enabled, Garden will use the basic logger. I.e., log status changes are rendered as new lines instead of being updated in-place.
  | `--version` |  | boolean | Show the current CLI version.
  | `--help` |  | boolean | Show help

### garden build

**Perform your Builds.**

Runs all or specified Builds, taking into account build dependency order.
Optionally stays running and automatically builds when sources (or dependencies' sources) change.

Examples:

    garden build                   # build everything in the project
    garden build my-image          # only build my-image
    garden build image-a image-b   # build image-a and image-b
    garden build --force           # force re-builds, even if builds had already been performed at current version
    garden build -l 3              # build with verbose log level to see the live log output

#### Usage

    garden build [names] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `names` | No | Specify Builds to run. You may specify multiple names, separated by spaces.

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--force` |  | boolean | Force re-build.
  | `--with-dependants` |  | boolean | Also rebuild any Builds that depend on one of the Builds specified as CLI arguments (recursively). Note: This option has no effect unless a list of Build names is specified as CLI arguments (since otherwise, every Build in the project will be performed anyway).

    garden cloud secrets list --filter-envs dev                        # list all secrets from the dev environment
    garden cloud secrets list --filter-envs dev --filter-names *_DB_*  # list all secrets from the dev environment that have '_DB_' in their name.

#### Usage

    garden cloud secrets list [options]

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--filter-envs` |  | array:string | Filter on environment. You may filter on multiple environments by setting this flag multiple times. Accepts glob patterns.&quot;

  | `--filter-names` |  | array:string | Filter on secret name. You may filter on multiple secret names by setting this flag multiple times. Accepts glob patterns.


### garden cloud secrets create

**Create secrets in Garden Cloud.**

Create secrets in Garden Cloud. You can create project wide secrets or optionally scope
them to an environment, or an environment and a user.

To scope secrets to a user, you will need the user's ID which you can get from the
`garden cloud users list` command.

You can optionally read the secrets from a file.

Examples:
    garden cloud secrets create DB_PASSWORD=my-pwd ACCESS_KEY=my-key   # create two secrets
    garden cloud secrets create ACCESS_KEY=my-key --scope-to-env ci    # create a secret and scope it to the ci environment
    garden cloud secrets create ACCESS_KEY=my-key --scope-to-env ci --scope-to-user 9  # create a secret and scope it to the ci environment and user with ID 9
    garden cloud secrets create --from-file /path/to/secrets.txt  # create secrets from the key value pairs in the secrets.txt file

#### Usage

    garden cloud secrets create [secrets] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `secrets` | No | The names and values of the secrets to create, separated by &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27;. You may specify multiple secret name/value pairs, separated by spaces. Note that you can also leave this empty and have Garden read the secrets from file.

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--scope-to-user-id` |  | string | Scope the secret to a user with the given ID. User scoped secrets must be scoped to an environment as well.
  | `--scope-to-env` |  | string | Scope the secret to an environment. Note that this does not default to the environment that the command runs in (i.e. the one set via the --env flag) and that you need to set this explicitly if you want to create an environment scoped secret.
  | `--from-file` |  | path | Read the secrets from the file at the given path. The file should have standard &quot;dotenv&quot; format, as defined by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).


### garden cloud secrets update

**Update secrets in Garden Cloud**

Update secrets in Garden Cloud. You can update the secrets by either specifying secret name or secret ID.

By default, the secrets are updated by name instead of secret ID.

When updating by name, only the existing secrets are updated by default.
The missing ones are skipped and reported as errors at the end of the command execution.
This behavior can be customized with the `--upsert` flag, so the missing secrets will be created.

If you have multiple secrets with same name across different environments and users, specify the environment and the user id using `--scope-to-env` and `--scope-to-user-id` flags.
Otherwise, the command will fail with an error.

To update the secrets by their IDs, use the `--update-by-id` flag.
To get the IDs of the secrets you want to update, run the `garden cloud secrets list` command.
The `--upsert` flag has no effect if it's used along with the `--update-by-id` flag.

Examples:
    garden cloud secrets update MY_SECRET=foo MY_SECRET_2=bar # update two secret values with the given names.
    garden cloud secrets update MY_SECRET=foo MY_SECRET_2=bar --upsert # update two secret values with the given names and create new ones if any are missing
    garden cloud secrets update MY_SECRET=foo MY_SECRET_2=bar --scope-to-env local --scope-to-user-id <user-id> # update two secret values with the given names for the environment local and specified user id.
    garden cloud secrets update <ID 1>=foo <ID 2>=bar --update-by-id # update two secret values with the given IDs.

#### Usage

    garden cloud secrets update [secretNamesOrIds] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `secretNamesOrIds` | No | The names and values of the secrets to update, separated by &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27;. You may specify multiple secret name/value pairs, separated by spaces. You can also pass pairs of secret IDs and values if you use &#x60;--update-by-id&#x60; flag. Note that you can also leave this empty and have Garden read the secrets from file.

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--upsert` |  | boolean | Set this flag to upsert secrets instead of only updating them. It means that the existing secrets will be updated while the missing secrets will be created. This flag works only while updating secrets by name, and has no effect with &#x60;--update-by-id&#x60; option.
  | `--update-by-id` |  | boolean | Update secret(s) by secret ID(s). By default, the command args are considered to be secret name(s). The &#x60;--upsert&#x60; flag has no effect with this option.
  | `--from-file` |  | path | Read the secrets from the file at the given path. The file should have standard &quot;dotenv&quot; format, as defined by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
  | `--scope-to-user-id` |  | string | Update the secret(s) in scope of user with the given user ID. This must be specified if you want to update secrets by name instead of secret ID.

### garden cleanup deploy

**Cleans up running deployments (or services if using modules).**

Cleans up (i.e. un-deploys) the specified actions. Cleans up all deploys/services in the project if no arguments are provided.
Note that this command does not take into account any deploys depending on the cleaned up actions, and might
therefore leave the project in an unstable state. Running `garden deploy` after will re-deploy anything missing.

Examples:

    garden cleanup deploy my-service # deletes my-service
    garden cleanup deploy            # deletes all deployed services in the project

#### Usage

    garden cleanup deploy [names] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `names` | No | The name(s) of the deploy(s) (or services if using modules) to delete. You may specify multiple names, separated by spaces.

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--dependants-first` |  | boolean | Clean up Deploy(s) (or services if using modules) in reverse dependency order. That is, if service-a has a dependency on service-b, service-a will be deleted before service-b when calling &#x60;garden cleanup namespace service-a,service-b --dependants-first&#x60;.

When this flag is not used, all services in the project are cleaned up simultaneously.
  | `--with-dependants` |  | boolean | Also clean up deployments/services that have dependencies on one of the deployments/services specified as CLI arguments (recursively).  When used, this option implies --dependants-first. Note: This option has no effect unless a list of names is specified as CLI arguments (since then, every deploy/service in the project will be deleted).

#### Outputs

```yaml

### garden deploy

**Deploy actions to your environment.**

Deploys all or specified Deploy actions, taking into account dependency order.
Also performs builds and other dependencies if needed.

Optionally stays running and automatically re-builds and re-deploys if sources
(or dependencies' sources) change.

Examples:

    garden deploy                      # deploy everything in the project
    garden deploy my-deploy            # only deploy my-deploy
    garden deploy deploy-a,deploy-b    # only deploy deploy-a and deploy-b
    garden deploy --force              # force re-deploy, even for deploys already deployed and up-to-date
    garden deploy --sync=my-deploy     # deploys all Deploys, with sync enabled for my-deploy
    garden deploy --sync               # deploys all compatible Deploys with sync enabled
    garden deploy --local=my-deploy    # deploys all Deploys, with local mode enabled for my-deploy
    garden deploy --local              # deploys all compatible Deploys with local mode enabled
    garden deploy --env stage          # deploy your Deploys to an environment called stage
    garden deploy --skip deploy-b      # deploy everything except deploy-b
    garden deploy --forward            # deploy everything and start port forwards without sync or local mode
    garden deploy my-deploy --logs     # deploy my-deploy and follow the log output from the deployed service
    garden deploy my-deploy -l 3       # deploy with verbose log level to see logs of the creation of the deployment

#### Usage

    garden deploy [names] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `names` | No | The name(s) of the Deploy(s) (or services if using modules) to deploy (skip to deploy everything). You may specify multiple names, separated by spaces.

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--force` |  | boolean | Force re-deploy.
  | `--force-build` |  | boolean | Force re-build of build dependencies.
  | `--sync` |  | array:string | The name(s) of the Deploy(s) to deploy with sync enabled.
You may specify multiple names by setting this flag multiple times.
Use * to deploy all supported deployments with sync enabled.

Important: The syncs stay active after the command exits. To stop the syncs, use the &#x60;sync stop&#x60; command.
  | `--local-mode` |  | array:string | [EXPERIMENTAL] The name(s) of Deploy(s) to be started locally with local mode enabled.

You may specify multiple Deploys by setting this flag multiple times. Use * to deploy all Deploys with local mode enabled. When this option is used,
the command stays running until explicitly aborted.

This always takes the precedence over sync mode if there are any conflicts, i.e. if the same Deploys are matched with both &#x60;--sync&#x60; and &#x60;--local&#x60; options.
  | `--skip` |  | array:string | The name(s) of Deploys you&#x27;d like to skip.
  | `--skip-dependencies` |  | boolean | Skip deploy, test and run dependencies. Build dependencies and runtime output reference dependencies are not skipped. This can be useful e.g. when your stack has already been deployed, and you want to run specific Deploys in sync mode without deploying or running dependencies that may have changed since you last deployed.
  | `--with-dependants` |  | boolean | Additionally deploy all deploy actions that are downstream dependants of the action(s) being deployed. This can be useful when you know you need to redeploy dependants.
  | `--disable-port-forwards` |  | boolean | Disable automatic port forwarding when running persistently. Note that you can also set GARDEN_DISABLE_PORT_FORWARDS&#x3D;true in your environment.
  | `--forward` |  | boolean | Create port forwards and leave process running after deploying. This is implied if any of --sync / --local or --logs are set.
  | `--logs` |  | boolean | Stream logs from the requested Deploy(s) (or services if using modules) during deployment, and leave the log streaming process running after deploying. Note: This option implies the --forward option.
  | `--timestamps` |  | boolean | Show timestamps with log output. Should be used with the &#x60;--logs&#x60; option (has no effect if that option is not used).
  | `--port` |  | number | The port number for the server to listen on (defaults to 9777 if available).

### garden exec

**Executes a command (such as an interactive shell) in a running service.**

Finds an active container for a deployed Deploy and executes the given command within the container.
Supports interactive shells.
You can specify the command to run as a parameter, or pass it after a `--` separator. For commands
with arguments or quoted substrings, use the `--` separator.

_NOTE: This command may not be supported for all action types. The use of the positional command argument
is deprecated. Use  `--` followed by your command instead._

Examples:

     garden exec my-service /bin/sh   # runs an interactive shell in the my-service Deploy's container
     garden exec my-service -- /bin/sh -c echo "hello world" # prints "hello world" in the my-service Deploy's container and exits

#### Usage

    garden exec <deploy> [command] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `deploy` | Yes | The running Deploy action to exec the command in.
  | `command` | No | The use of the positional command argument is deprecated. Use  &#x60;--&#x60; followed by your command instead.

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--interactive` |  | boolean | Set to false to skip interactive mode and just output the command result
  | `--target` |  | string | Specify name of the target if a Deploy action consists of multiple components. _NOTE: This option is only relevant in certain scenarios and will be ignored otherwise._ For Kubernetes deploy actions, this is useful if a Deployment includes multiple containers, such as sidecar containers. By default, the container with &#x60;kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container&#x60; annotation or the first container is picked.

#### Outputs

```yaml
# The exit code of the command executed.
code:

# The output of the executed command.
output:

# The stdout output of the executed command (if available).
stdout:

# The stderr output of the executed command (if available).
stderr:
```

### garden get graph

**Outputs the dependency relationships across the project.**


#### Usage

#### Usage

    garden get modules [modules] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `modules` | No | Specify module(s) to list. You may specify multiple modules, separated by spaces. Skip to return all modules.

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--full` |  | boolean | Show the full config for each module, with template strings resolved. Has no effect when the --output option is used.
  | `--exclude-disabled` |  | boolean | Exclude disabled modules from output.

#### Outputs

```yaml
# Key/value map. Keys must be valid identifiers.
modules:
  # The configuration for a module.
  <name>:
    kind:

    # The type of this module.
    type:

    # The name of this module.
    name:

    # Specify how to build the module. Note that plugins may define additional keys on this object.
    build:
      # A list of modules that must be built before this module is built.
      dependencies:
        - # Module name to build ahead of this module.
          name:

          # Specify one or more files or directories to copy from the built dependency to this module.
          copy:
            - # POSIX-style path or filename of the directory or file(s) to copy to the target.
              source:

              # POSIX-style path or filename to copy the directory or file(s), relative to the build directory.
              # Defaults to the same as source path.
              target:

      # Maximum time in seconds to wait for build to finish.
      timeout:

    # If set to true, Garden will run the build command, services, tests, and tasks in the module source directory,
    # instead of in the Garden build directory (under .garden/build/<module-name>).
    #
    # Garden will therefore not stage the build for local modules. This means that include/exclude filters
    # and ignore files are not applied to local modules, except to calculate the module/action versions.
    #
    # If you use use `build.dependencies[].copy` for one or more build dependencies of this module, the copied files
    # will be copied to the module source directory (instead of the build directory, as is the default case when
    # `local = false`).
    #
    # Note: This maps to the `buildAtSource` option in this module's generated Build action (if any).
    local:

    # A description of the module.
    description:

    # Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules
    # based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: ${environment.name ==
    # "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for
    # development.
    #
    # Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also
    # means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in
    # which case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).
    #
    # If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden
    # will automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the
    # module's service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you
    # need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.
    disabled:

    # Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files
    # that do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding
    # to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.
    #
    # Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your
    # source tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files
    # guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for
    # details.
    #
    # Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.
    include:

    # Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match
    # these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch
    # events, and when staging builds.
    #
    # Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include`
    # field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the
    # [Configuration Files
    # guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for
    # details.
    #
    # Unlike the `scan.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and
    # directories are watched for changes. Use the project `scan.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large
    # directories that should not be watched for changes.
    exclude:

    # A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific
    # branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>

    # garden.yml file.
    repositoryUrl:

    allowPublish:

    # A map of variables scoped to this particular module. These are resolved before any other parts of the module
    # configuration and take precedence over project-scoped variables. They may reference project-scoped variables,

    variables:
      <name>:

    # Specify a path (relative to the module root) to a file containing variables, that we apply on top of the
    # module-level `variables` field.
    #
    # The format of the files is determined by the configured file's extension:
    #
    # * `.yaml`/`.yml` - YAML. The file must consist of a YAML document, which must be a map (dictionary). Keys may
    # contain any value type. YAML format is used by default.
    # * `.env` - Standard "dotenv" format, as defined by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
    # * `.json` - JSON. Must contain a single JSON _object_ (not an array).
    #
    # _NOTE: The default varfile format was changed to YAML in Garden v0.13, since YAML allows for definition of
    # nested objects and arrays._
    #
    # To use different module-level varfiles in different environments, you can template in the environment name
    # to the varfile name, e.g. `varfile: "my-module.${environment.name}.env` (this assumes that the corresponding
    # varfiles exist).
    varfile:

    # The filesystem path of the module.

### garden logs

**Retrieves the most recent logs for the specified Deploy(s).**

Outputs logs for all or specified Deploys, and optionally waits for new logs to come in.
Defaults to getting logs from the last minute when in `--follow` mode. You can change this with the `--since` or `--tail` options.

Examples:

    garden logs                            # interleaves color-coded logs from all Deploys (up to a certain limit)
    garden logs --since 2d                 # interleaves color-coded logs from all Deploys from the last 2 days
    garden logs --tail 100                 # interleaves the last 100 log lines from all Deploys
    garden logs deploy-a,deploy-b          # interleaves color-coded logs for deploy-a and deploy-b
    garden logs --follow                   # keeps running and streams all incoming logs to the console
    garden logs --tag container=service-a  # only shows logs from containers with names matching the pattern

#### Usage

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `names` | No | The name(s) of the Deploy(s) to log (skip to get logs from all Deploys in the project). You may specify multiple names, separated by spaces.

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--tag` |  | array:tag | Only show log lines that match the given tag, e.g. &#x60;--tag &#x27;container&#x3D;foo&#x27;&#x60;. If you specify multiple filters in a single tag option (e.g. &#x60;--tag &#x27;container&#x3D;foo,someOtherTag&#x3D;bar&#x27;&#x60;), they must all be matched. If you provide multiple &#x60;--tag&#x60; options (e.g. &#x60;--tag &#x27;container&#x3D;api&#x27; --tag &#x27;container&#x3D;frontend&#x27;&#x60;), they will be OR-ed together (i.e. if any of them match, the log line will be included). You can specify glob-style wildcards, e.g. &#x60;--tag &#x27;container&#x3D;prefix-*&#x27;&#x60;.
  | `--follow` |  | boolean | Continuously stream new logs. When the &#x60;--follow&#x60; option is set, we default to &#x60;--since 1m&#x60;.
  | `--tail` |  | number | Number of lines to show for each deployment. Defaults to showing all log lines (up to a certain limit). Takes precedence over the &#x60;--since&#x60; flag if both are set. Note that we don&#x27;t recommend using a large value here when in follow mode.
  | `--show-tags` |  | boolean | Show any tags attached to each log line. May not apply to all providers
  | `--timestamps` |  | boolean | Show timestamps with log output.
  | `--since` |  | moment | Only show logs newer than a relative duration like 5s, 2m, or 3h. Defaults to &#x60;&quot;1m&quot;&#x60; when &#x60;--follow&#x60; is true unless &#x60;--tail&#x60; is set. Note that we don&#x27;t recommend using a large value here when in follow mode.
  | `--hide-name` |  | boolean | Hide the action name and render the logs directly.

### garden publish

**Build and publish artifacts (e.g. container images) to a remote registry.**

Publishes built artifacts for all or specified builds. Also builds dependencies if needed.

By default the artifacts/images are tagged with the Garden action version,
but you can also specify the `--tag` option to specify a specific string tag _or_ a templated tag.
Any template values that can be used on the build being tagged are available,
in addition to ${build.name}, ${build.version} and ${build.hash}
tags that allows referencing the name of the build being tagged, as well as its Garden version.
${build.version} includes the "v-" prefix normally used for Garden versions, ${build.hash} doesn't.

Examples:

    garden publish                # publish artifacts for all builds in the project
    garden publish my-container   # only publish my-container
    garden publish --force-build  # force re-build before publishing artifacts

    # Publish my-container with a tag of v0.1
    garden publish my-container --tag "v0.1"

    # Publish my-container with a tag of v1.2-<hash> (e.g. v1.2-abcdef123)
    garden publish my-container --tag "v1.2-${build.hash}"

### garden run

**Perform one or more Run actions**

This is useful for any ad-hoc Runs, for example database migrations, or when developing.

Examples:

    garden run my-db-migration   # run my-db-migration
    garden run my-run -l 3       # run with verbose log level to see the live log output

#### Usage

    garden run [names] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `names` | No | The name(s) of the Run action(s) to perform. You may specify multiple names, separated by spaces. Accepts glob patterns (e.g. init* would run both &#x27;init&#x27; and &#x27;initialize&#x27;).

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--force` |  | boolean | Run even if the action is disabled for the environment, and/or a successful result is found in cache.
  | `--force-build` |  | boolean | Force re-build of Build dependencies before running.
  | `--module` |  | array:string | The name(s) of one or modules to pull Runs (or tasks if using modules) from. If both this and Run names are specified, the Run names filter the tasks found in the specified modules.
  | `--skip` |  | array:string | The name(s) of Runs you&#x27;d like to skip. Accepts glob patterns (e.g. init* would skip both &#x27;init&#x27; and &#x27;initialize&#x27;).
  | `--skip-dependencies` |  | boolean | Don&#x27;t perform any Deploy or Run actions that the requested Runs depend on.
This can be useful e.g. when your stack has already been deployed, and you want to run Tests with runtime
dependencies without redeploying any Deploy (or service if using modules) dependencies that may have changed since you last deployed.

Warning: Take great care when using this option in CI, since Garden won&#x27;t ensure that the runtime dependencies of
your test suites are up to date when this option is used.

    garden test my-test             # run the my-test Test action
    garden test --module my-module  # run all Tests in the my-module module
    garden test *integ*             # run all Tests with a name containing 'integ'
    garden test *unit,*lint         # run all Tests ending with either 'unit' or 'lint' in the project
    garden test --force             # force Tests to be re-run, even if they've already run successfully
    garden test -l 3                # run with verbose log level to see the live log output

#### Usage

    garden test [names] [options]

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `names` | No | The name(s) of the Test action(s) to test (skip to run all tests in the project). You may specify multiple test names, separated by spaces. Accepts glob patterns (e.g. integ* would run both &#x27;integ&#x27; and &#x27;integration&#x27;).

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--name` |  | array:string | DEPRECATED: This option will be removed in 0.14. Please use a positional argument &quot;&lt;module name&gt;-&lt;test name&gt;&quot; or &quot;*-&lt;test name&gt;&quot; instead of of &quot;--name&quot;.
This option can be used to run all tests with the specified name (e.g. unit or integ) in declared in any module.
Note: Since 0.13, using the --name option is equivalent to using the positional argument &quot;*-&lt;test name&gt;&quot;. This means that new tests declared using the new Action kinds will also be executed if their name matches this pattern.
Accepts glob patterns (e.g. integ* would run both &#x27;integ&#x27; and &#x27;integration&#x27;).
  | `--force` |  | boolean | Force re-run of Test, even if a successful result is found in cache.
  | `--force-build` |  | boolean | Force rebuild of any Build dependencies encountered.
  | `--interactive` |  | boolean | Run the specified Test in interactive mode (i.e. to allow attaching to a shell). A single test must be selected, otherwise an error is thrown.
  | `--module` |  | array:string | The name(s) of one or modules to run tests from. If both this and test names are specified, the test names filter the tests found in the specified modules.
  | `--skip` |  | array:string | The name(s) of tests you&#x27;d like to skip. Accepts glob patterns (e.g. integ* would skip both &#x27;integ&#x27; and &#x27;integration&#x27;). Applied after the &#x27;name&#x27; filter.
  | `--skip-dependencies` |  | boolean | Don&#x27;t deploy any Deploys (or services if using modules) or run any Run actions (or tasks if using modules) that the requested tests depend on. This can be useful e.g. when your stack has already been deployed, and you want to run Tests with runtime dependencies without redeploying any Deploy (or service) dependencies that may have changed since you last deployed. Warning: Take great care when using this option in CI, since Garden won&#x27;t ensure that the runtime dependencies of your test suites are up to date when this option is used.

### garden tools

**Access tools included by providers.**

Run a tool defined by a provider in your project, downloading and extracting it if necessary. Run without arguments to get a list of all tools available.

Run with the --get-path flag to just print the path to the binary or library directory (depending on the tool type). If the tool is a non-executable library, this flag is implicit.

When multiple plugins provide a tool with the same name, you can choose a specific plugin/version by specifying <plugin name>.<tool name>, instead of just <tool name>. This is generally advisable when using this command in scripts, to avoid accidental conflicts.

When there are name conflicts and a plugin name is not specified, we first prefer tools defined by configured providers in the current project (if applicable), and then alphabetical by plugin name.

Examples:

    # Run kubectl with <args>.
    garden tools kubectl -- <args>

    # Run the kubectl version defined specifically by the `kubernetes` plugin.
    garden tools kubernetes.kubectl -- <args>

    # Print the path to the kubernetes.kubectl tool to stdout, instead of running it.
    garden tools kubernetes.kubectl --get-path

    # List all available tools.
    garden tools

    garden validate --resolve deploy.my-service
    garden validate --resolve '*'                # fully resolve all actions
    garden validate --resolve                    # fully resolve all actions

#### Usage

    garden validate [options]

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--resolve` |  | array:string | Fully resolve a specific action, including references to runtime outputs from other actions. Actions should be specified as &#x60;&lt;kind&gt;.&lt;name&gt;&#x60; (e.g. &#x60;deploy.my-service&#x60; or &#x60;build.my-image&#x60;). This option can be specified multiple times to fully resolve multiple actions. Use * to fully resolve all actions. Note that this may result in actions being executed during validation (e.g. if a runtime output is referenced by another action, it will be executed in order to fully resolve the config). In such cases, we recommend not using this option.


### garden version

**Shows the current garden version.**


#### Usage

    garden version
