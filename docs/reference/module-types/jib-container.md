# `jib-container` Module Type

{% hint style="warning" %}
Modules are deprecated and will be removed in version `0.14`. Please use [action](../../using-garden/actions.md)-based configuration instead. See the [0.12 to Bonsai migration guide](../../guides/migrating-to-bonsai.md) for details.
{% endhint %}

## Description

Extends the [container type](./container.md) to build the image with [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib). Use this to efficiently build container images for Java services. Check out the [jib example](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/tree/0.13.37/examples/jib-container) to see it in action.

The image is always built locally, directly from the source directory (see the note on that below), before shipping the container image to the right place. You can set `build.tarOnly: true` to only build the image as a tarball.

By default (and when not using remote building), the image is pushed to the local Docker daemon, to match the behavior of and stay compatible with normal `container` actions.

When using remote building with the `kubernetes` provider, the image is synced to the cluster (where individual layers are cached) and then pushed to the deployment registry from there. This is to make sure any registry auth works seamlessly and exactly like for normal Docker image builds.

Please consult the [Jib documentation](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) for how to configure Jib in your Gradle or Maven project.

To provide additional arguments to Gradle/Maven when building, you can set the `extraFlags` field.

**Important note:** Unlike many other types, `jib-container` builds are done from the _source_ directory instead of the build staging directory, because of how Java projects are often laid out across a repository. This means build dependency copy directives are effectively ignored, and any include/exclude statements and .gardenignore files will not impact the build result. _Note that you should still configure includes, excludes and/or a .gardenignore to tell Garden which files to consider as part of the Build version hash, to correctly detect whether a new build is required.**

Below is the full schema reference. For an introduction to configuring Garden modules, please look at our [Configuration
guide](../../using-garden/configuration-overview.md).

The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

`jib-container` modules also export values that are available in template strings. See the [Outputs](#outputs) section below for details.

## Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
kind: Module

# The type of this module.

  #
  # To use an arbitrary JDK distribution, please use the `jdkPath` configuration option.
  jdkVersion: 11

  # The JDK home path. This **always overrides** the JDK defined in `jdkVersion`.
  #
  # The value will be used as `JAVA_HOME` environment variable for Gradle and Maven.
  jdkPath:

  # Build the image and push to a local Docker daemon (i.e. use the `jib:dockerBuild` / `jibDockerBuild` target).
  dockerBuild: false

  # Don't load or push the resulting image to a Docker daemon or registry, only build it as a tar file.

  tarFormat: docker

  # Defines the location of the custom executable Gradle binary.
  #
  # If not provided, then the Gradle binary available in the working directory will be used.
  # If no Gradle binary found in the working dir, then Gradle 7.5.1 will be downloaded and used.
  #
  # **Note!** Either `jdkVersion` or `jdkPath` will be used to define `JAVA_HOME` environment variable for the custom

  # [EXPERIMENTAL] Enable/disable concurrent Maven and Maven Daemon builds.
  #
  # Note! Concurrent builds can be unstable. This option is disabled by default.
  # This option must be configured for each Build action individually.
  concurrentMavenBuilds: false

  # Specify extra flags to pass to maven/gradle when building the container image.
  extraFlags:

# If set to true, Garden will run the build command, services, tests, and tasks in the module source directory,
# instead of in the Garden build directory (under .garden/build/<module-name>).
#
# Garden will therefore not stage the build for local modules. This means that include/exclude filters
# and ignore files are not applied to local modules, except to calculate the module/action versions.
#
# If you use use `build.dependencies[].copy` for one or more build dependencies of this module, the copied files
# will be copied to the module source directory (instead of the build directory, as is the default case when
# `local = false`).
#
# Note: This maps to the `buildAtSource` option in this module's generated Build action (if any).
local: false

# A description of the module.
description:

# Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules
# based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: ${environment.name == "prod"}`).
# This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.
#
# Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also
# means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which
# case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).
#
# If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will
# automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's
# service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make
# sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.
disabled: false

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that
# do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to
# filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source
# tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files
# guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for
# details.
#
# Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.
#
# If neither `include` nor `exclude` is set, and the module has a Dockerfile, Garden
# will parse the Dockerfile and automatically set `include` to match the files and
# folders added to the Docker image (via the `COPY` and `ADD` directives in the Dockerfile).
#
# If neither `include` nor `exclude` is set, and the module
# specifies a remote image, Garden automatically sets `include` to `[]`.
include:

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match these
# paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events,
# and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include`
# field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration
# Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories)
# for details.
#
# Unlike the `scan.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and
# directories are watched for changes. Use the project `scan.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large
# directories that should not be watched for changes.
exclude:

# A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific
# branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>
#
# Garden will import the repository source code into this module, but read the module's config from the local
# garden.yml file.
repositoryUrl:

# When false, disables pushing this module to remote registries via the publish command.
allowPublish: true

# A list of files to write to the module directory when resolving this module. This is useful to automatically
# generate (and template) any supporting files needed for the module.
generateFiles:
  - # POSIX-style filename to read the source file contents from, relative to the path of the module (or the
    # ConfigTemplate configuration file if one is being applied).
    # This file may contain template strings, much like any other field in the configuration.
    sourcePath:

    # POSIX-style filename to write the resolved file contents to, relative to the path of the module source directory
    # (for remote modules this means the root of the module repository, otherwise the directory of the module
    # configuration).
    #
    # Note that any existing file with the same name will be overwritten. If the path contains one or more
    # directories, they will be automatically created if missing.
    targetPath:

    # By default, Garden will attempt to resolve any Garden template strings in source files. Set this to false to
    # skip resolving template strings. Note that this does not apply when setting the `value` field, since that's
    # resolved earlier when parsing the configuration.
    resolveTemplates: true

    # The desired file contents as a string.
    value:

# A map of variables scoped to this particular module. These are resolved before any other parts of the module
# configuration and take precedence over project-scoped variables. They may reference project-scoped variables, and
# generally use any template strings normally allowed when resolving modules.
variables:

# Specify a path (relative to the module root) to a file containing variables, that we apply on top of the
# module-level `variables` field.
#
# The format of the files is determined by the configured file's extension:
#
# * `.yaml`/`.yml` - YAML. The file must consist of a YAML document, which must be a map (dictionary). Keys may
# contain any value type. YAML format is used by default.
# * `.env` - Standard "dotenv" format, as defined by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
# * `.json` - JSON. Must contain a single JSON _object_ (not an array).
#
# _NOTE: The default varfile format was changed to YAML in Garden v0.13, since YAML allows for definition of nested
# objects and arrays._
#
# To use different module-level varfiles in different environments, you can template in the environment name
# to the varfile name, e.g. `varfile: "my-module.${environment.name}.env` (this assumes that the corresponding
# varfiles exist).
varfile:

# Specify build arguments to use when building the container image.
#
# Note: Garden will always set a `GARDEN_ACTION_VERSION` (alias `GARDEN_MODULE_VERSION`) argument with the
# module/build version at build time.
buildArgs: {}

# Specify extra flags to use when building the container image. Note that arguments may not be portable across
# implementations.
extraFlags:

# Specify the platforms to build the image for. This is useful when building multi-platform images.
# The format is `os/arch`, e.g. `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, etc.
platforms:

# Secret values that can be mounted in the Dockerfile, but do not become part of the image filesystem or image
# manifest. This is useful e.g. for private registry auth tokens.
#
# Build arguments and environment variables are inappropriate for secrets, as they persist in the final image.
#
# The secret can later be consumed in the Dockerfile like so:
#   RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mytoken TOKEN=$(cat /run/secrets/mytoken) ...
#
# See also https://docs.docker.com/build/building/secrets/
secrets:

# Specify the image name for the container. Should be a valid Docker image identifier. If specified and the module
# does not contain a Dockerfile, this image will be used to deploy services for this module. If specified and the
# module does contain a Dockerfile, this identifier is used when pushing the built image.

# POSIX-style name of a Dockerfile, relative to module root.
dockerfile:

# A list of services to deploy from this container module.
services:
  - # Valid RFC1035/RFC1123 (DNS) label (may contain lowercase letters, numbers and dashes, must start with a letter,
    # and cannot end with a dash), cannot contain consecutive dashes or start with `garden`, or be longer than 63
    # characters.

{% endhint %}

[EXPERIMENTAL] Enable/disable concurrent Maven and Maven Daemon builds.

Note! Concurrent builds can be unstable. This option is disabled by default.
This option must be configured for each Build action individually.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `false` | No       |

### `build.extraFlags[]`

[build](#build) > extraFlags

Specify extra flags to pass to maven/gradle when building the container image.

| Type            | Required |
| --------------- | -------- |
| `array[string]` | No       |

### `local`

If set to true, Garden will run the build command, services, tests, and tasks in the module source directory,
instead of in the Garden build directory (under .garden/build/<module-name>).

Garden will therefore not stage the build for local modules. This means that include/exclude filters
and ignore files are not applied to local modules, except to calculate the module/action versions.

If you use use `build.dependencies[].copy` for one or more build dependencies of this module, the copied files
will be copied to the module source directory (instead of the build directory, as is the default case when
`local = false`).

Note: This maps to the `buildAtSource` option in this module's generated Build action (if any).

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `false` | No       |

### `description`

A description of the module.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

### `disabled`

Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: ${environment.name == "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.

Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).

If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `false` | No       |

### `include[]`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.

Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.

If neither `include` nor `exclude` is set, and the module has a Dockerfile, Garden
will parse the Dockerfile and automatically set `include` to match the files and
folders added to the Docker image (via the `COPY` and `ADD` directives in the Dockerfile).

If neither `include` nor `exclude` is set, and the module
specifies a remote image, Garden automatically sets `include` to `[]`.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `array[posixPath]` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
include:
  - Dockerfile
  - my-app.js
```

### `exclude[]`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.

Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include` field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Unlike the `scan.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and directories are watched for changes. Use the project `scan.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large directories that should not be watched for changes.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `array[posixPath]` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
exclude:
  - tmp/**/*
  - '*.log'
```

### `repositoryUrl`

A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>

Garden will import the repository source code into this module, but read the module's config from the local garden.yml file.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `gitUrl \| string` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
repositoryUrl: "git+https://github.com/org/repo.git#v2.0"
```

### `allowPublish`

When false, disables pushing this module to remote registries via the publish command.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  | No       |

### `generateFiles[]`

A list of files to write to the module directory when resolving this module. This is useful to automatically generate (and template) any supporting files needed for the module.

| Type            | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `array[object]` | `[]`    | No       |

### `generateFiles[].sourcePath`

[generateFiles](#generatefiles) > sourcePath

POSIX-style filename to read the source file contents from, relative to the path of the module (or the ConfigTemplate configuration file if one is being applied).
This file may contain template strings, much like any other field in the configuration.

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | No       |

### `generateFiles[].targetPath`

[generateFiles](#generatefiles) > targetPath

POSIX-style filename to write the resolved file contents to, relative to the path of the module source directory (for remote modules this means the root of the module repository, otherwise the directory of the module configuration).

Note that any existing file with the same name will be overwritten. If the path contains one or more directories, they will be automatically created if missing.

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | Yes      |

### `generateFiles[].resolveTemplates`

[generateFiles](#generatefiles) > resolveTemplates

By default, Garden will attempt to resolve any Garden template strings in source files. Set this to false to skip resolving template strings. Note that this does not apply when setting the `value` field, since that's resolved earlier when parsing the configuration.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  | No       |

### `generateFiles[].value`

[generateFiles](#generatefiles) > value

The desired file contents as a string.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

### `variables`

A map of variables scoped to this particular module. These are resolved before any other parts of the module configuration and take precedence over project-scoped variables. They may reference project-scoped variables, and generally use any template strings normally allowed when resolving modules.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `object` | No       |

### `varfile`

Specify a path (relative to the module root) to a file containing variables, that we apply on top of the
module-level `variables` field.

The format of the files is determined by the configured file's extension:

* `.yaml`/`.yml` - YAML. The file must consist of a YAML document, which must be a map (dictionary). Keys may contain any value type. YAML format is used by default.
* `.env` - Standard "dotenv" format, as defined by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
* `.json` - JSON. Must contain a single JSON _object_ (not an array).

_NOTE: The default varfile format was changed to YAML in Garden v0.13, since YAML allows for definition of nested objects and arrays._

To use different module-level varfiles in different environments, you can template in the environment name
to the varfile name, e.g. `varfile: "my-module.${environment.name}.env` (this assumes that the corresponding
varfiles exist).

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
varfile: "my-module.env"
```

### `buildArgs`

Specify build arguments to use when building the container image.

Note: Garden will always set a `GARDEN_ACTION_VERSION` (alias `GARDEN_MODULE_VERSION`) argument with the module/build version at build time.

| Type     | Default | Required |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| `object` | `{}`    | No       |

### `extraFlags[]`

Specify extra flags to use when building the container image. Note that arguments may not be portable across implementations.

| Type            | Required |
| --------------- | -------- |
| `array[string]` | No       |

### `platforms[]`

Specify the platforms to build the image for. This is useful when building multi-platform images.
The format is `os/arch`, e.g. `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, etc.

| Type            | Required |
| --------------- | -------- |
| `array[string]` | No       |

### `secrets`

Secret values that can be mounted in the Dockerfile, but do not become part of the image filesystem or image manifest. This is useful e.g. for private registry auth tokens.

Build arguments and environment variables are inappropriate for secrets, as they persist in the final image.

The secret can later be consumed in the Dockerfile like so:
```
  RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mytoken TOKEN=$(cat /run/secrets/mytoken) ...
```

See also https://docs.docker.com/build/building/secrets/

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `object` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
secrets:
    mytoken: supersecret
```

### `image`

Specify the image name for the container. Should be a valid Docker image identifier. If specified and the module does not contain a Dockerfile, this image will be used to deploy services for this module. If specified and the module does contain a Dockerfile, this identifier is used when pushing the built image.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

### `dockerfile`

POSIX-style name of a Dockerfile, relative to module root.

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | No       |

### `services[]`

A list of services to deploy from this container module.

### `services[].dependencies[]`

[services](#services) > dependencies

The names of any services that this service depends on at runtime, and the names of any tasks that should be executed before this service is deployed.

| Type            | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `array[string]` | `[]`    | No       |

### `services[].disabled`

[services](#services) > disabled

Set this to `true` to disable the service. You can use this with conditional template strings to enable/disable services based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `enabled: ${environment.name != "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only need certain services for specific environments, e.g. only for development.

Disabling a service means that it will not be deployed, and will also be ignored if it is declared as a runtime dependency for another service, test or task.

Note however that template strings referencing the service's outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the service is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.

### `services[].volumes[].module`

[services](#services) > [volumes](#servicesvolumes) > module

The name of a _volume module_ that should be mounted at `containerPath`. The supported module types will depend on which provider you are using. The `kubernetes` provider supports the [persistentvolumeclaim module](./persistentvolumeclaim.md), for example.

When a `module` is specified, the referenced module/volume will be automatically configured as a runtime dependency of this service, as well as a build dependency of this module.

Note: Make sure to pay attention to the supported `accessModes` of the referenced volume. Unless it supports the ReadWriteMany access mode, you'll need to make sure it is not configured to be mounted by multiple services at the same time.

### `services[].sync.paths[].source`

[services](#services) > [sync](#servicessync) > [paths](#servicessyncpaths) > source

Path to a local directory to be synchronized with the target.
This should generally be a templated path to another action's source path (e.g. `${actions.build.my-container-image.sourcePath}`), or a relative path.
If a path is hard-coded, we recommend sticking with relative paths here, and using forward slashes (`/`) as a delimiter, as Windows-style paths with back slashes (`\`) and absolute paths will work on some platforms, but they are not portable and will not work for users on other platforms.
Defaults to the Deploy action's config's directory if no value is provided.

You can use this with conditional template strings to enable/disable tasks based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `enabled: ${environment.name != "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only want certain tasks to run in specific environments, e.g. only for development.

Disabling a task means that it will not be run, and will also be ignored if it is declared as a runtime dependency for another service, test or task.

Note however that template strings referencing the task's outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the task is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.

### `tasks[].image`

[tasks](#tasks) > image

Specify an image ID to deploy. Should be a valid Docker image identifier. Required if no `build` is specified.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

### `tasks[].cacheResult`

[tasks](#tasks) > cacheResult

Set to false if you don't want the Runs's result to be cached. Use this if the Run needs to be run any time your project (or one or more of the Run's dependants) is deployed. Otherwise the Run is only re-run when its version changes, or when you run `garden run`.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  | No       |
