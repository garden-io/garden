# `templated` Module Type

{% hint style="warning" %}
Modules are deprecated and will be removed in version `0.14`. Please use [action](../../using-garden/actions.md)-based configuration instead. See the [0.12 to Bonsai migration guide](../../guides/migrating-to-bonsai.md) for details.
{% endhint %}

## Description

**[DEPRECATED] Please use the new `RenderTemplate` config kind instead.**

A special module type, for rendering [module templates](../../using-garden/config-templates.md). See the [Config Templates guide](../../using-garden/config-templates.md) for more information.

Specify the name of a ConfigTemplate with the `template` field, and provide any expected inputs using the `inputs` field. The generated modules becomes sub-modules of this module.

Note that the following common Module configuration fields are disallowed for this module type:
`build`, `local`, `description`, `include`, `exclude`, `repositoryUrl`, `allowPublish`, `generateFiles`, `variables` and `varfile`

Below is the full schema reference. For an introduction to configuring Garden modules, please look at our [Configuration
guide](../../using-garden/configuration-overview.md).

The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

`templated` modules also export values that are available in template strings. See the [Outputs](#outputs) section below for details.

## Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
kind: Module

# The type of this module.
type:

# The name of this module.
name:

# Specify how to build the module. Note that plugins may define additional keys on this object.
build:
  # A list of modules that must be built before this module is built.
  dependencies:
    - # Module name to build ahead of this module.
      name:

      # Specify one or more files or directories to copy from the built dependency to this module.
      copy:
        - # POSIX-style path or filename of the directory or file(s) to copy to the target.
          source:

          # POSIX-style path or filename to copy the directory or file(s), relative to the build directory.
          # Defaults to the same as source path.
          target:

  # Maximum time in seconds to wait for build to finish.
  timeout: 600

# If set to true, Garden will run the build command, services, tests, and tasks in the module source directory,
# instead of in the Garden build directory (under .garden/build/<module-name>).
#
# Garden will therefore not stage the build for local modules. This means that include/exclude filters
# and ignore files are not applied to local modules, except to calculate the module/action versions.
#
# If you use use `build.dependencies[].copy` for one or more build dependencies of this module, the copied files
# will be copied to the module source directory (instead of the build directory, as is the default case when
# `local = false`).
#
# Note: This maps to the `buildAtSource` option in this module's generated Build action (if any).
local: false

# A description of the module.
description:

# Set to true to skip rendering this template.
disabled: false

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that
# do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to
# filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source
# tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files
# guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for
# details.
#
# Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.
include:

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match these
# paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events,
# and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include`
# field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration
# Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories)
# for details.
#
# Unlike the `scan.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and
# directories are watched for changes. Use the project `scan.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large
# directories that should not be watched for changes.
exclude:

# A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific
# branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>
#
# Garden will import the repository source code into this module, but read the module's config from the local
# garden.yml file.
repositoryUrl:

# When false, disables pushing this module to remote registries via the publish command.
allowPublish: true

# A list of files to write to the module directory when resolving this module. This is useful to automatically
# generate (and template) any supporting files needed for the module.
generateFiles:
  - # POSIX-style filename to read the source file contents from, relative to the path of the module (or the
    # ConfigTemplate configuration file if one is being applied).
    # This file may contain template strings, much like any other field in the configuration.
    sourcePath:

    # POSIX-style filename to write the resolved file contents to, relative to the path of the module source directory
    # (for remote modules this means the root of the module repository, otherwise the directory of the module
    # configuration).
    #
    # Note that any existing file with the same name will be overwritten. If the path contains one or more
    # directories, they will be automatically created if missing.
    targetPath:

    # By default, Garden will attempt to resolve any Garden template strings in source files. Set this to false to
    # skip resolving template strings. Note that this does not apply when setting the `value` field, since that's
    # resolved earlier when parsing the configuration.
    resolveTemplates: true

    # The desired file contents as a string.
    value:

# A map of variables scoped to this particular module. These are resolved before any other parts of the module
# configuration and take precedence over project-scoped variables. They may reference project-scoped variables, and
# generally use any template strings normally allowed when resolving modules.
variables:

# Specify a path (relative to the module root) to a file containing variables, that we apply on top of the
# module-level `variables` field.
#
# The format of the files is determined by the configured file's extension:
#
# * `.yaml`/`.yml` - YAML. The file must consist of a YAML document, which must be a map (dictionary). Keys may
# contain any value type. YAML format is used by default.
# * `.env` - Standard "dotenv" format, as defined by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
# * `.json` - JSON. Must contain a single JSON _object_ (not an array).
#
# _NOTE: The default varfile format was changed to YAML in Garden v0.13, since YAML allows for definition of nested
# objects and arrays._
#
# To use different module-level varfiles in different environments, you can template in the environment name
# to the varfile name, e.g. `varfile: "my-module.${environment.name}.env` (this assumes that the corresponding
# varfiles exist).
varfile:

# The ConfigTemplate to use to generate the sub-modules of this module.
template:

# A map of inputs to pass to the ConfigTemplate. These must match the inputs schema of the ConfigTemplate.
#
# Note: You can use template strings for the inputs, but be aware that inputs that are used to generate the resulting
# config names and other top-level identifiers must be resolvable when scanning for configs, and thus cannot reference
# other actions, modules or runtime variables. See the [environment configuration context
# reference](../template-strings/environments.md) to see template strings that are safe to use for inputs used to
# generate config identifiers.
inputs:

If you also specify the `include` field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Unlike the `scan.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and directories are watched for changes. Use the project `scan.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large directories that should not be watched for changes.
