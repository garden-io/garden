# `terraform` Module Type

## Description

Resolves a Terraform stack and either applies it automatically (if `autoApply: true`) or warns when the stack resources are not up-to-date.

**Note: It is not recommended to set `autoApply` to `true` for any production or shared environments, since this may result in accidental or conflicting changes to the stack.** Instead, it is recommended to manually plan and apply using the provided plugin commands. Run `garden plugins terraform` for details.

Stack outputs are made available as service outputs, that can be referenced by other modules under `${runtime.services.<module-name>.outputs.<key>}`. You can template in those values as e.g. command arguments or environment variables for other services.

Note that you can also declare a Terraform root in the `terraform` provider configuration by setting the `initRoot` parameter. This may be preferable if you need the outputs of the Terraform stack to be available to other provider configurations, e.g. if you spin up an environment with the Terraform provider, and then use outputs from that to configure another provider or other modules via `${providers.terraform.outputs.<key>}` template strings.

See the [Terraform guide](https://docs.garden.io/advanced/terraform) for a high-level introduction to the `terraform` provider.

Below is the full schema reference. For an introduction to configuring Garden modules, please look at our [Configuration
guide](../../guides/configuration-files.md).

The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

`terraform` modules also export values that are available in template strings. See the [Outputs](#outputs) section below for details.

## Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
# The schema version of this module's config (currently not used).
apiVersion: garden.io/v0

kind: Module

# The type of this module.
type:

# The name of this module.
name:

# A description of the module.
description:

# Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules
# based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: \${environment.name == "prod"}`).
# This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.
#
# Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also
# means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which
# case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).
#
# If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will
# automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's
# service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make
# sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.
disabled: false

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that
# do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to
# filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source
# tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files
# guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.
#
# Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.

# paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events,
# and when staging builds.

# Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include`
# field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration
# Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories)for

### `kind`

| Type     | Allowed Values | Default    | Required |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `string` | "Module"       | `"Module"` | Yes      |

### `type`

The type of this module.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | Yes      |

Example:

```yaml
type: "container"
```

### `name`

The name of this module.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | Yes      |

Example:

```

### `description`

A description of the module.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

### `disabled`

Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: \${environment.name == "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.

Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).

If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `false` | No       |

### `include[]`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.

Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `array[posixPath]` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
include:
  - Dockerfile
  - my-app.js
```

### `exclude[]`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.

Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include` field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories)for details.

Unlike the `modules.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and directories are watched for changes. Use the project `modules.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large directories that should not be watched for changes.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `array[posixPath]` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
exclude:

  - '*.log'
```

### `repositoryUrl`

A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>

Garden will import the repository source code into this module, but read the module's config from the local garden.yml file.

| Type              | Required |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| `gitUrl | string` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
repositoryUrl: "git+https://github.com/org/repo.git#v2.0"
```

### `allowPublish`

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  | No       |

### `build`

| `posixPath` | `""`    | No       |

### `autoApply`

If set to true, Garden will automatically run `terraform apply -auto-approve` when the stack is not

| -------- |
| `string` |

Example:

```yaml
my-variable: ${modules.my-module.buildPath}
