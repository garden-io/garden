#  Welcome!

Welcome to the official Garden documentation site 👋

Here you'll find (hopefully) everything you need to know on how to set up and use Garden for your development and testing workflows.

**If you're new to Garden and are working on setting up your project**, we recommend the following:

* Start by going through our [Quickstart Guide](./basics/quickstart.md). This will give you a basic overview of Garden's main features.
* Next, go through the [Your First Project tutorial](./tutorials/your-first-project/README.md). This tutorial helps you create configuration for an example project that you can then apply to your own. And if you get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to our [our Discord community](https://discord.gg/gxeuDgp6Xt).
* Finally, check-out our [Adopting Garden guide](./guides/adopting-garden.md) which gives you a high-level overview of how to adopt Garden and roll it out to your team.

**If your team has already set up a project for Garden**, and you just need to learn how to use the Garden CLI, you may find it helpful to skip straight to the [Installation](./basics/quickstart.md#step-1-install-garden) and [Using the CLI](./using-garden/using-the-cli.md) guides, but we do still recommend learning [How Garden Works](./basics/how-garden-works.md) and about [The Stack Graph and the general terminology](./basics/stack-graph.md).

**If you need help as an open source user**, please get in touch via [our Discord community](https://discord.gg/gxeuDgp6Xt). Our team monitors it closely, and we encourage you to reach out with questions about Garden.

**If you'd like to learn more about Garden Cloud**, please see [our website](https://garden.io/plans).

If there's something you can't find in our docs, we happily encourage you to [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/gxeuDgp6Xt) and/or file an issue on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/garden-io/garden). We're more than happy to help!
