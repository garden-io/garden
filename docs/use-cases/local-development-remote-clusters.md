title: Local Development With Remote Clusters
order: 4

## Why develop with remote clusters?

Most teams using Garden use Kubernetes for production. This means they already have their Dockerfiles, manifests and/or Helm charts.

Garden lets them shift these resources left, without introducing friction or cognitive overload to developers, so that they can:

- Run their entire project in the cloud _as they develop_, irrespective of its size
- Share build caches with their team so that no two developers have to wait for the same build
- Easily write and maintain integration and end-to-end tests
- Developers barely need any dependencies on their local machines and new developers can be on-boarded in minutes
- Catch "production" bugs before they end up in production

If you worry your laptop may catch fire next time you run docker compose up, remote environments might be for you.

## How does it work?

![Start the dev console, deploy in sync mode, and view progress in the dashboard](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/assets/5373776/914a7695-6453-4b34-becf-eab387e478a0)

Developers start their day by running `garden dev` and deploy their project into an isolated namespace in the team's Kubernetes development cluster, re-using existing config and manifests but overwriting values as needed with Gardenâ€™s template syntax.

Teams then use Gardenâ€™s sync functionality to live reload changes into running Pods in the remote cluster, without needing a full re-build or re-deploy on every code change. Thereâ€™s typically a trade of between how realistic your environment is and the speed of the feedback but with Garden you can get both.

## Key features

- **Visualize your dependency graph**, streams logs, and view command history with the [Garden dashboard](https://app.garden.io)
- **Accelerate build times** with [remote image builds](../k8s-plugins/guides/in-cluster-building.md) and smart caching
- **Hot reload** your code to containers running in your local and remote Kubernetes clusters for a smooth inner loop with [Code Synchronization](https://docs.garden.io/guides/code-synchronization).
- **Proxy local services** with [Local Mode](../guides/running-service-in-local-mode.md)

## How can my team develop against remote clusters?

Teams typically [adopt Garden in a few phases](../overview/adopting-garden.md) and using remote clusters for inner loop development tends to be one of the last ones. Each phase solves a unique problem though so its well worth the journey.

So with that in mind, here are the recommended next steps:

- Go through our [Quickstart guide](../getting-started/quickstart.md)
- Check out the [First Project tutorial](../tutorials/README.md) and/or [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/0y5E8K-8kr4)
- [Set up your remote cluster](../k8s-plugins/remote-k8s/README.md)
- [Add actions](../k8s-plugins/actions/README.md) to build and deploy your project
- [Configure code syncing](../guides/code-synchronization.md) so you can live reload changes to the remote cluster
