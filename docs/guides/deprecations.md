# Migrating to

The next major version of Garden, 0.14 (Cedar), will contain breaking changes. To make the update as seamless as possible for
your team, avoid functionality that has been deprecated in Garden 0.13.

When using `apiVersion: garden.io/v1` in your project configuration file, Garden will warn you if your configuration
depends on features that will be removed in Garden 0.14.

We recommend to opt-in to the new behaviour in Garden 0.14 by using `apiVersion: garden.io/v2`. This setting
will make Garden throw errors whenever it detects use of deprecated functionality.

If your config is using `apiVersion: garden.io/v2`, you can safely update to 0.14 without the update affecting your workflows.

   ## Garden commands

<h3 id="loginRequirement">Login requirement</h3>

For projects that are connected to Garden Cloud, Garden 0.14 will require you to login.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
Garden 0.14 will use the Garden Cloud backend for determining the cache status of Kubernetes `Test` and `Run` actions kinds (See also [`ConfigMap`-based cache for Kubernetes actions](#configMapBasedCache)).

This means the cache is only available when connecting your project with Garden Cloud.

We'll also celebrate general availability of the Container Builder. It can significantly improve your Docker build performance.

To avoid your team from suffering from cache misses and bad performance, we'll require you to log in if your project is connected to Garden Cloud.

**We don't want to be in your way if you can't log in right now**, be it because you are lacking permissions or because you're offline.

This is why we also offer an escape hatch: If you want to proceed without logging in, just call Garden with the option `--offline` or the environment variable `GARDEN_OFFLINE=1`.

<h3 id="configMapBasedCache"><code>ConfigMap</code>-based cache for Kubernetes actions</h3>

The `ConfigMap`-based cache will not be available anymore in Garden 0.14.

Garden 0.14 will use the Garden Cloud backend for determining the cache status of Kubernetes `Test` and `Run` actions kinds, instead using your Kubernetes cluster as a database by storing `ConfigMap` objects.

This means the cache is only available when connecting your project with Garden Cloud.

We are doing this because `ConfigMap` manifests in your Kubernetes cluster are not designed for storing `Test` and `Run` action statuses.

We've seen Kubernetes clusters where the number of `ConfigMap` manifests grew very large and causing reliability issues.

Also, the storage location for the cache limits the functionality: It's not possible, for instance, to share test caches across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

This meant, for example, that if your team us using the `local-kubernetes` provider, you wouldn't be able to benefit from the cache of other team members.

The `ConfigMap`-based storage also limited the amount of data we can store for each cache entry.

With Garden 0.14, we are offering a **Team Cache** option with a new storage backend in Garden Cloud. It will put us in a position where we can bring Gardens cache capabilities to the next level.

<h3 id="kubernetesClusterInitCommand"><code>garden kubernetes cluster-init</code></h3>

This command will be removed in 0.14. Do not use this command. It has no effect.

<h3 id="syncStartCommand"><code>garden sync start</code></h3>

The command `garden sync start` will only be available inside the dev console (`garden dev`) in the next major version of Garden, 0.14. Do not use it as a standalone Garden command.

Please run `garden deploy --sync` instead, to start the dev console.

You can also start the dev console by running `garden dev` and then use the `sync start` command inside the dev shell. The same applies to all other sync commands.

<h3 id="syncStopCommand"><code>garden sync stop</code></h3>

The command `garden sync stop` will only be available inside the dev console (`garden dev`) in the next major version of Garden, 0.14. Do not use it as a standalone Garden command. Instead, we recommend running `garden deploy --sync`, or alternatively starting syncs inside the dev console (`garden dev`) using `sync stop`.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
See also [the deprecation notice for the `garden sync start` command](#syncStartCommand).

<h3 id="syncRestartCommand"><code>garden sync restart</code></h3>

The command `garden sync restart` will only be available inside the dev console (`garden dev`) in the next major version of Garden, 0.14. Do not use it as a standalone Garden command.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
See also [the deprecation notice for the `garden sync start` command](#syncStartCommand).

<h3 id="syncStatusCommand"><code>garden sync status</code></h3>

The command `garden sync status` will only be available inside the dev console (`garden dev`) in the next major version of Garden, 0.14. Do not use it as a standalone Garden command.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
See also [the deprecation notice for the `garden sync start` command](#syncStartCommand).

## Kubernetes provider configuration

<h3 id="containerDeploymentStrategy">The <code>deploymentStrategy</code> config field</h3>

The `deploymentStrategy` config field will be removed in Garden 0.14.
Do not use this config field. It has no effect as the experimental support for blue/green deployments (via the `blue-green` strategy) has been removed.

## Project configuration

<h3 id="dotIgnoreFiles">The <code>dotIgnoreFiles</code> config field</h3>

The `dotIgnoreFiles` config field will be removed in Garden 0.14.
Use the `dotIgnoreFile` field instead. It only allows specifying one filename.

For more information, please refer to the [`dotIgnoreFile` reference documentation](../reference/project-config.md#dotIgnoreFile).

<h3 id="apiVersion">The <code>apiVersion</code> config field</h3>

Update your Garden configuration, so breaking changes in Garden 0.14 will not affect your workflows.

Garden uses the `apiVersion` setting in your project configuration to understand which version of Garden your configuration has been written for.

Garden 0.14 (Cedar) will only support the setting `apiVersion: garden.io/v2` in your project configuration file. Using this setting in the latest versions of Garden 0.13 (Bonsai) will reject using functionality that is not supported in Garden 0.14 (Cedar) anymore.

Using `apiVersion: garden.io/v0`, or not specifying `apiVersion` at all in the project configuration, indicates the configuration has been written for Garden version 0.12 (Acorn), and using `apiVersion: garden.io/v1` means your configuration has been written for Garden version 0.13 (Bonsai). **These settings will not be supported anymore in Garden 0.14 (Cedar)**.

Full Example:
```yaml
# project.garden.yml
apiVersion: garden.io/v1 # <-- This indicates that the configuration has been written for Garden 0.13 (Bonsai).
kind: Project
name: garden-core

environments:
- name: dev

providers:
- name: local-kubernetes
```

Please follow the steps in this document when Garden tells you that you're affected by changed behaviour in 0.14. After that, you can change your `apiVersion` setting to `garden.io/v2`:

```yaml
# project.garden.yml
apiVersion: garden.io/v2 # <-- Use this setting to adopt the new behaviour in Garden 0.14. Your configuration will work with the latest versions of Garden 0.13, and with any version of Garden 0.14.
kind: Project
name: garden-core

environments:
- name: dev

providers:
- name: local-kubernetes
```

<h3 id="projectConfigModules">The <code>modules</code> config field</h3>

The `modules` config field will be removed in Garden 0.14. Do not use the `modules` field, as it has been renamed to `scan`. Please use the `scan` field instead.

For more information, please refer to the [`scan` reference documentation](../reference/project-config.md#scan).

## Garden Plugins

<h3 id="hadolintPlugin">The <code>hadolint</code> plugin</h3>

Do not use the `hadolint` plugin explicitly, as it will be removed in the next version of Garden, 0.14.

[Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) is a Dockerfile linter written in Haskell. It can be used to enforce best practices.

If you want to keep using hadolint, you can use an `exec` action instead:

```yaml
kind: test
type: exec
name: dockerfile-hadolint
include: ["Dockerfile"]
spec:
 command: [hadolint, "Dockerfile"]
```

<h3 id="octantPlugin">The <code>octant</code> plugin</h3>

Do not use the `octant` plugin explicitly, as it will be removed in the next version of Garden, 0.14.

The `octant` plugin does not have any effect since the integrated dashboard has been removed in Garden 0.13.0.

<h3 id="conftestPlugin">The <code>conftest</code> plugin</h3>

Do not use the `conftest` plugin explicitly, as it will be removed in the next version of Garden, 0.14.

[Conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/) is a utility to help you write tests against structured configuration data.

If you want to keep using conftest, you can use an `exec` action instead:

```yaml
kind: test
type: exec
name: conftest
include:
- "policy/**/*.rego"
- deployment.yaml
spec:
 command: [conftest, test, deployment.yaml]
```

## Local mode

<h3 id="localMode">Using <code>spec.localMode</code> in <code>helm</code>, <code>kubernetes</code> and <code>container</code> deploy actions</h3>

The local mode will be removed in the next major version of Garden, 0.14.

Use the `sync mode` instead. You can also consider using [mirrord](https://mirrord.dev/) or [telepresence](https://www.telepresence.io/).

See also:
- [`spec.localMode` in the `kubernetes` deploy action reference](../reference/action-types/Deploy/container.md#spec.localmode).
- [`spec.localMode` in the `helm` deploy action reference](../reference/action-types/Deploy/helm.md#spec.localmode).
- [`spec.localMode` in the `container` deploy action reference](../reference/action-types/Deploy/container.md#spec.localmode).

## Action configs

<h3 id="buildConfigFieldOnRuntimeActions">The <code>build</code> config field in runtime action configs</h3>

Use the `dependencies` config to define the build dependencies. Using the `build` config field in runtime actions will not be supported anymore in Garden 0.14.

Please replace all root-level configuration entries like `build: my-app` with the `dependencies: [build.my-app]`.

For example, a configuration like

```yaml
kind: Build
name: backend
description: Backend service container image
type: container

---
kind: Deploy
name: backend
description: Backend service container
type: container
build: backend # <-- old config style uses `build` field

spec:
image: ${actions.build.backend.outputs.deploymentImageId}
...
```

should be replaced with

```yaml
kind: Build
name: backend
description: Backend service container image
type: container

---
kind: Deploy
name: backend
description: Backend service container
type: container

# use `dependencies` field instead of the `build`
dependencies:
- build.backend

spec:
image: ${actions.build.backend.outputs.deploymentImageId}
...
```

## Build Staging

<h3 id="rsyncBuildStaging"><code>rsync</code>-based build staging</h3>

Do not use `GARDEN_LEGACY_BUILD_STAGE` environment variable. It will be removed in Garden 0.14.

Using the `rsync`-based build staging is not necessary when using the latest versions of Garden.

If you still need to use this environment variable for some reason, please reach out to us on GitHub, Discord or via the customer support.

## Garden action types

<h3 id="configmapDeployAction">The <code>configmap</code> deploy action type</h3>

The `configmap` deploy action type will be removed in the next major version of Garden, 0.14. Please use the `kubernetes` deploy action type with a `configmap` Kubernetes manifest instead.

Example:

```yaml
# garden.yml
kind: Deploy
type: kubernetes
name: game-demo-configmap
spec:
 manifests:
   - apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: game-demo
     data:
       player_initial_lives: "3"
       ui_properties_file_name: "user-interface.properties"
       game.properties: |
         enemy.types=aliens,monsters
         player.maximum-lives=5
       user-interface.properties: |
         color.good=purple
         color.bad=yellow
         allow.textmode=true
```

<h3 id="persistentvolumeclaimDeployAction">The <code>persistentvolumeclaim</code> deploy action type</h3>

The `persistentvolumeclaim` deploy action type will be removed in the next major version of Garden, 0.14. Please use the `kubernetes` deploy action type instead.

For more information how to use Persistent Volume Claims using Kubernetes manifests, refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation on configuring persistent volume storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/).

## Template Language

<h3 id="optionalTemplateValueSyntax">The optional template value syntax (like <code>${var.foo}?</code>)</h3>

The optional template value syntax will be removed in Garden 0.14. Use explicit fallback values instead, e.g. `${var.foo || null}`.

There were some issues with the syntax for optional template values in the template language.

For example, what do you expect the following template to evaluate to:

```yaml
# ...
variables:
 baseUrl: https://example.com/
 fullUrl: ${var.baseUrl}?param=xyz # <-- users expect this to evaluate to https://example.com/?param=xyz
```

When using `apiVersion: garden.io/v1`, the question mark is considered part of the template expression and thus `fullUrl` evaluates to `https://example.com/param=xyz` and there is no error if `var.baseUrl` doesn't exist.

When using `apiVersion: garden.io/v2`, the question mark operator has been removed and thus `fullUrl` evaluates to `https://example.com/?param=xyz` and resolving the action will fail if `var.baseUrl` doesn't exist.

## Default configuration values

<h3 id="waitForJobs"><code>spec.waitForJobs</code> of <code>kubernetes Deploy</code></h3>

In Garden 0.14, the default value of `spec.waitForJobs` will change to `true`. You can adopt the new behaviour by declaring `apiVersion: garden.io/v2` in your project configuraiton.

This means that deploy actions will wait for jobs to complete by default when applying Job manifests.

For more information about jobs, please refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation on Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/).
