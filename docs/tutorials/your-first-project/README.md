This tutorial walks you through the steps of adding Garden to a project. Our [example project](https://github.com/garden-io/web-app-example) is a three-tier web app that we'll be deploying to Kubernetes.

In the tutorial we'll:

1. [Create a Garden project](./1-initialize-a-project.md)
2. [Pick our Kubernetes plugin and set it up](./2-connect-to-a-cluster.md)
3. [Add actions to the project](./3-add-actions.md)
4. [Add tests to the project](./4-testing.md)
5. [Enable code syncing](./5-code-syncing.md)
6. [..and discuss next steps](./6-configure-your-project.md)

## Requirements

- You'll need to have Garden installed to follow along with this guide. You'll find the instructions in our [Quickstart guide](../../getting-started/quickstart.md).
- We also recommend quickly reading the [Garden Basics](../../getting-started/basics.md) page before carrying on.

Once you've done that, head on over to the [next page](./1-initialize-a-project.md)!
