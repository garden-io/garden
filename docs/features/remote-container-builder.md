title: Remote Container Builder
order: 1
---

The Remote Container Builder enables you to build container images using **blazing-fast, remote build compute instances** managed by Garden. Each built layer of your Dockerfile is stored on low-latency, high-throughput NVMe storage so that your entire team can benefit from shared build caches. This can result in [significantly faster builds](https://garden.io/blog/oem-cloud-builder).

Our free-tier includes a certain amount of build minutes and GBs of layer caching per month and you get more by switching to our team or enterprise tiers. You can learn more about the [different tiers here](https://garden.io/plans).

You can also use the [Builds UI](https://app.garden.io) to view build logs and analyze bottlenecks in your builds.

## Using the Remote Container Builder

To use the Remote Container Builder you need to first [connect your project to the Garden Cloud backend](../guides/connecting-project.md).

Then you need to enable it in your project level Garden configuration by adding the following provider config:

```yaml

  - name: container
    gardenContainerBuilder:
      enabled: true
```

You can learn more about [enabling the Remote Container Builder here](../garden-for/containers/using-remote-container-builder.md).
