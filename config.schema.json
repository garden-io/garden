In most scenarios, the default behavior is desired and leads to the most predictable and verifiable builds, as well as avoiding potential confusion around file watching.\n\nYou _can_ override this by setting `buildAtSource: true`, which basically sets the build root for this action at the location of the Build action config in the source tree. This means e.g. that the build command in `exec` Builds runs at the source, and for Docker image builds the build is initiated from the source directory.\n\nAn important implication is that `include` and `exclude` directives for the action, as well as `.gardenignore` files, only affect version hash computation but are otherwise not effective in controlling the build context. This may lead to unexpected variation in builds with the same version hash. **This may also slow down code synchronization to remote destinations, e.g. when performing remote Docker image builds.**\n\nAdditionally, any `exec` runtime actions (and potentially others) that reference this Build with the `build` field, will run from the source directory of this action.\n\nWhile there may be good reasons to do this in some situations, please be aware that this increases the potential for side-effects and variability in builds. **You must take extra care**, including making sure that files generated during builds are excluded with e.g. `.gardenignore` files or `exclude` fields on potentially affected actions.
